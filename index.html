<h2><a name="new">I've developed a change to the language. Next steps?</a></h2>

<p>Great, first write a proposal, try to get it approved by Andrew et al. Once it's rejected, congratulations, this
means it's been automatically approved by me for inclusion on this site. Once a compiler code is available, will be merged by
???? and our playground will be updated already support your version of the language! It's this easy! Do not forget to provide
a demo test samples that demonstrate the language change made by you.</p>

<h2><a name="faq">FAQ</a></h2>

<h3>Go iL what about Go 2.0???</h3>

<p> Sure, most of changes have to wait until 2.0, see below</p>

<h3>Please stop! Go language is finished, these changes aren't approved?</h3>

<p>Relax man, it's just a toy project by newbies. will die any minute now. You can rest assured Go won't be changed. respect all authorities:)

<h3>Why custom mascot?</h3>
<p>The name of our friendly mascot is <b>Goli</b>. To make it clear that these are an unofficial projects not considered to be the "Go language". Sadly, most of the changes on site may never leave the playground lab and get into an usable state, or even reach production Go release.

<h3>Playground down?</h3>

<p>Someone shut down the playground machine again. In the meantime there should be archived outputs for demo samples.</p>
